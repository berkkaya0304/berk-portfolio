I was the one who controlled the classroom computer using scratch codes I developed in computer classes and realized even when I was very young. Now I'm taking the measures necessary to become a successful engineer. With strenuous effort and the expertise, I gained from my institution, I am confident rather than hopeful that this will be accomplished. I'm attempting to obtain numerous credentials and training for this.",
