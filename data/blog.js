# Being a Chief Young Officer (CYO)

## Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Berk. Today, I would like to talk to you about a role that is perhaps not so prominent at the moment, but which I expect to be indispensable for companies in the coming years. The role I want to talk about today is Chief Young Officer(CYO).

## What is Chief Young Officer?

The Chief Young Officer is generally the person who manages the communication with both the young people within the companies and the candidate young people and makes the necessary arrangements within the company according to their needs.

In particular, companies are currently trying to regulate their communication with young people. However, current organisation charts are insufficient for this and fail to attract the necessary young talent.

## Importance for the Future of the Company

The involvement of young people in companies is extremely important. Because young people adapt to current technologies more easily than other employees, their ideas provide added value at this point.

In fact, some companies are currently working on several reverse mentoring programmes to support this. In my opinion, the CYO will actually be the lead person in managing such programmes.

## Case Study of the Being a CYO

> **_Created by ChatGPT. Controlled by me._**

***Case Study: The Role and Impact of a Chief Young Officer (CYO)***

***Background:***

*GlobalTech, a prominent technology company, had been struggling with a high turnover rate among its young employees, many of whom felt disconnected from the company's traditional structure. Despite its reputation as an industry leader, the company was finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain young talent, resulting in a lack of fresh perspectives and innovative ideas.*

***Challenge:***

*GlobalTech's traditional organizational structure made it challenging for young employees to voice their opinions, share ideas, and feel engaged with the company's long-term vision. Although there were HR initiatives aimed at improving engagement, they often fell short of addressing the specific needs and values of young professionals. Recognizing that the younger workforce was essential for innovation and future growth, GlobalTech decided to introduce a new role to bridge this gap: the Chief Young Officer (CYO).*

***The Solution: Chief Young Officer***

*GlobalTech appointed a CYO responsible for strengthening relationships between the company and its young employees, as well as prospective young talent. The CYO's responsibilities included:*

***Creating a Youth Advisory Board:*** *The CYO established a board where young employees could regularly meet and discuss their challenges, ideas, and needs. This board worked closely with leadership to provide valuable input on projects, policies, and company culture.*

***Streamlining Internal Communication:*** *The CYO introduced communication channels tailored to the preferences of younger employees, including digital platforms and more informal check-ins. This enabled a transparent and accessible space for the exchange of ideas.*

***Tailoring Professional Development Programs:*** *Understanding that young professionals are often looking for rapid career growth and skill development, the CYO customized training programs to support their career goals and promote skill-building.*

***Revamping the Recruitment Process:*** *To attract top young talent, the CYO led an overhaul of the recruitment process, introducing more authentic and relatable interactions with prospective employees. This included engaging with college students and young professionals on social media, hosting Q&A sessions, and sharing real-life success stories from GlobalTech.*

***Impact:***

*After a year with the CYO in place, GlobalTech reported a notable improvement in employee engagement and retention among its young workforce. New hires expressed a stronger sense of belonging, and there was a 25% decrease in turnover for employees under 30. The Youth Advisory Board's input helped the company pivot in ways that aligned better with young employees' values, making GlobalTech's culture more inclusive and adaptable.*

***Conclusion:***

*The introduction of the Chief Young Officer at GlobalTech proved to be an effective solution to bridging the gap between the company and the younger workforce. This role not only improved internal dynamics but also enhanced GlobalTech's reputation as an innovative, youth-friendly employer. As a result, the CYO became an invaluable asset in ensuring that the company remained relevant, adaptable, and attractive to the next generation of talent.*

## Conclusion

In this article, I have mentioned the importance of young people in a company through a general concept.`,

# ‚òÅÔ∏èCreating a MySQL Container in Huawei Cloud w/ Cloud Container Engine

## Introduction

Hi everyone!

In this article I will explain in general what the Cloud Container Engine is, how it works and how you can set up a mysql using it.

I wish good readings to everyone. I would like to start this article with the question, "What is CCE?". CCE is a one-stop platform integrating compute (ECS or BMS), networking (VPC, EIP, and ELB), storage (EVS, OBS, and SFS), and many other services. It supports heterogeneous computing architectures such as GPU, NPU, and Arm. Multi-AZ, multi-region disaster recovery ensures high availability of Kubernetes clusters.

Cloud Container Engine(CCE) has so many [product advantages](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/productdesc-cce/cce_productdesc_0003.html).

Now that you have general information about CCE, we can focus on how to get CCE and how to install mysql on a cce.

## Demo of Cloud Container Engine(CCE)

### Step 1: Enable CCE for the First Time and Perform Authorization

If you are opening the CCE Console for the first time from the top left of the page, you must accept the incoming agreement.

### Step 2: Create a Cluster

On the page that opens, you need to click on the Buy Cluster button. In the window that opens, you can create it by filling in the necessary parameters as in the picture.

### Step 3: Create a Node Pool and Nodes in the Cluster

At this stage, we will create a node pool and nodes in the cluster. From the Nodes tab, you need to select Node Pools and then create node pool. Then you will be able to see it like the picture below.

If you have properly selected the properties of the node, you can now submit. After that, you can press the scaling button as below and select the number 1 on the screen that opens.

After these steps, you just need to wait 10 minutes and your node on which you will install mysql is ready.

### Step 4: Deploy MySQL

At this stage, there are two different paths. One is the operations that can be done with kubectl. The other can be done via CCE Console. I will do it through **CCE Console**.

In which CCE you want to install it, you need to click on it and enter its settings. After that, you need to click on the Workloads section and enter its settings.

Click on Create Workload and select the stateful option from the options above as shown below and fill in the other settings as shown in the pictures.

Once you have made these settings, you can move on to the container settings, which are very important for a mysql statefulset.

***If you can't select mysql here, you may need to throw it from your own docker screen.***

After making the necessary environment variables settings, we create and add an Elastic Volume Service (EVS).

After adding it, we also make the necessary headless settings so that we can access it directly with the ip given in the headless.

If you have done everything correctly, the mysql statefulset should be running as below. If you see something else, you may have done a step wrong.

## Conclusionüòä

In this article, I showed you how you can create a CCE and a Node using Cloud Container Engine (CCE). I also showed you how you can install mysql container with statefulset on the Node.

Now you have seen how you can install mysql on CCE in general. I hope this article was useful for you. See you in my other articles üòä`,

# Different Look at Web Development

## Introduction

Hi Everyone! This week, you will have the chance to learn the basics of web development from the perspective of an undergraduate student. Before I start, let me tell you about myself to make it easier for you to see the issue from my point of view. I would like to start by asking myself a question and sharing the answer with you. The question is **"Who am I?".**

*This question may actually have much better answers on the philosophical side :))*

I'm an undergraduate student trying to train myself as a good computer engineer. I'm interested in learning new things about technology in general and creating new content about them.

I would like to start by explaining what web development is for an undergraduate student.

**_Alert_** *You will not find classic definitions of web development in this article. You can easily find it in many articles already. I will approach it from a slightly different perspective.*

## What is Web Development?

I want you to imagine that you are a computer science or software engineering student just starting school and you have no experience in software. You have been told about programming languages from the first class and you have typed "The easiest programming language" on the internet to avoid too much difficulty.

 ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî "***Try This Please Right Now***"

You came across HTML (which is not even a programming language). You started writing and easily printed Hello World on the web screen. (It sounds so easy right now, doesn't it?) But you couldn't find the excitement of doing something for the first time, even when you were trying to overcome many difficult algorithms.

This is where web development stands for me. Even though I experienced this situation before the license period, it was very valuable to be able to directly see the change in the software you made. (Especially Frontend ‚Äî We will come to this part again in the future)

Berk, you told us a story here, but you still haven't answered the question of what is web development? But I think every programmer has a story for each field. These stories are sometimes exciting and sometimes extremely boring. But they are always there. So I would like to ask my first thought-provoking question in this section: 

> **"Why did you decide to read an article about web development?"**

***Alert*** *I told you this article would be different from the usual, didn't I? :))*

If you've given it some thought, let's continue our journey. Now that you've thought about your story, we're ready to dive into the areas of web development.

## What is Back-End and Front-End?

Now I want you to think about which of the two different superhero options is closer to you. **SuperHero 1:** This superhero is doing great things and everyone knows him. When he goes out on the street, everyone pays attention to him.

**SuperHero 2:** This superhero is doing great things again, but no one knows who he really is. He keeps a low profile on the street and lives a normal life.

The difference between these superheroes summarizes the situation between Front-End and Back-End.

Front-end is always in the spotlight because it is the part directly accessed by the user, but is Back-End? The normal user doesn't even know it exists. (Let's appreciate Back-End Developers please :)))

And now I want to move on to my other question:

> **"What drove you to the superhero you didn't choose?"**

## Conclusionüòä

In general, in this article I have tried to provide you with a different perspective on web development. I hope these different perspectives have been useful to you.`,

# Do true leaders never lose or do they learn from every loss?

## Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Berk. I wanted to write this article because of a few thoughts that came to my mind recently. Do leaders never lose? Or is there no such thing as losing and they always learn? This situation can actually be easily said that of course they learn. But what is the situation behind it?

I may not be able to find an answer to this in this not very long article, but the purpose of my articles is not to give you everything, but to make you think about it.

In this article, I would like to give you the perspective of a student who has applied to many competitions or programs and received many rejections. But even if he was rejected or lost, he learned a lot from these processes.

## Lose or Learn?

First of all, I think we should start with what it means to lose. I think losing is falling short of what one expects from oneself. In other words, it is when you think you will be accepted to a program and you are not. Because if you didn't think you would be accepted, there would be no expectations and not being selected would not cause you any problems.

So, if we have solved the confusion about losing, now it is time to learn... I think learning is being able to take something for your future life from the situations that life brings you. I mean, why do you study a subject? To pass an exam, of course... Or to face a challenge and solve it so that the next time you face it you can solve it more easily, right? Because that knowledge is in your permanent memory. You have now learned that information.

Now that we have solved these two concepts, we can look for an answer to the question of which one a leader focuses on :))

## Do Leaders Lose or Learn?

Leaders do not lose. Even when they look like losers from the outside, leaders know how to turn defeat into victory by always focusing on the next step forward.

This is where Nelson Mandela's important quote below comes into play. A leader either wins or learns. They have no other choice. All their lives they act according to this system they have created in their heads.

If you want to become one of the great leaders who have made a name for themselves, the formula is clear... Don't lose, just learn.

## Conclusion

In the end, leaders don't lose, they just burn a new learning opportunity. I have tried to emphasize this as much as I can in this article.`,

# Effective Leadership and Cornerstones

## Introduction

Hi everyone!

This article focuses on effective leadership and cornerstones of it. In particular, this article will provide information on these issues, while also including examples of leaders who are or have been living on these issues.

I wish good readings to everyone.

I would like to start by explaining what leadership means to me, because as you know, leadership has many meanings. I think leadership generally covers every environment, starting from the person himself/herself to his/her team. Because a person has to be the leader of himself/herself at first. If he has succeeded in being the leader of himself, it will be easier for him to be the leader of a team.

I would like to describe all the characteristics of a leader in this article, but for a subject like leadership, even mentioning thousands of characteristics would not be enough. So in this article I will focus on the 5 most important cornerstones.

These 5 characteristics are **Vision, Communication, Reliability, Decision Making Ability** and **Emotional Intelligence.**

## 1- Vision

> "Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." ‚Äî **Warren Bennis**

**Vision** is one of the essential characteristics of a leader. A leader without a vision will not be able to make the right decisions today that will affect the future. In this case, lack of vision will always be a problem and will affect both himself and his community in a bad way.

A leader without a vision will not be able to make the right decisions today that will affect the future. In this case, lack of vision will always be a problem and will affect both himself and his community in a bad way.

For reasons like these, vision is one of the cornerstones of leadership. When we look at great leaders, we will always see a vision. The founder of the Republic of Turkey, the Great Leader Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, put forward a vision in a situation where Turkey was surrounded from all four sides and perhaps thanks to this vision, he redetermined the destiny of a nation. *(With respect to Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk)*

## 2- Communication

> "To lead people, walk behind them. But to communicate effectively as a leader, walk among them." ‚Äî **Lao Tzu**

One of the cornerstones of leadership is, of course, **Communication**. Communication is known to affect a person's life from the beginning to the end. Communication, which is one of the competencies that can add value to our lives, is inevitable here.

From the moment you first meet a person to the parts where you strengthen your relationship, communication is the most important part. When leaders enter the environment, it seems that they easily shape it in a way that they can almost play with communication thanks to their strong communication.

Mahatma Gandhi stood out as a strong communicative leader. His speeches, writings, and actions conveyed powerful messages of peace, civil disobedience, and social justice, inspiring millions to join his cause. People with strong communication skills, such as Mahatma Gandhi, can explain their ideas to people more easily and convince them.

## 3- Reliability

> "Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships." ‚Äî **Stephen R. Covey**

**Reliability** is one of the most important cornerstones for leadership. I want you to go back in time. Think of a community where you were not a leader, just a participant. The trust you had in your leader will immediately come to mind. But if you don't trust your leader in this memory, you will also remember that there is no team.

Communities that do not trust their leaders have always gone through difficult times. Either new leaders have emerged in these societies and neutralized the influence of the old one. Or those societies have closed down, never to be formed again.

An example of a reliable leader is Nelson Mandela. He was such a trusted leader that he was elected as the first black president of the Republic of South Africa. Many movies have been made and books written about him. Throughout his life he was involved in many civil-society movements and became an increasingly reliable leader.

## 4- Decision Making Ability

> "Nothing is more difficult, and therefore more precious, than to be able to decide." ‚Äî **Napoleon Bonaparte**

**Decision-Making** is another cornerstone that is indispensable for leaders. The ability to make decisions is essential in determining the destiny of a company, a person or a community. So it would be strange not to see the cornerstone of leaders in this article I wrote.

I want you to imagine that you are in a community whose leaders are incapable of making decisions. What would that community be like? Its leaders would always be independent of each other and wrong decisions would be taken. The community would never get where it deserves to be.

When we look at world leaders, leaders come to the fore at this point. In this article, I would like to talk about Steve Jobs in particular, because with his decision-making ability, Steve Jobs has brought Apple to the points it deserves and made it stand out among other companies.

## 5- Emotional Intelligence

> "What really matters for success, character, happiness, and lifelong achievements is a definite set of emotional skills ‚Äî your EQ ‚Äî not just purely cognitive abilities that are measured by conventional IQ tests." ‚Äî **Daniel Goleman**

**Emotional Intelligence** is essential for a leader. Because with their emotional intelligence, leaders can understand the emotions of the other person and appeal to these emotions. Thanks to this, they can attract attention and stand out in every environment they are in.

Imagine yourself as a community leader and this community consists of 1000 people. Imagine that you need to keep in touch with this many people and have a strong relationship with them. Great leaders can easily handle this part and even use it to their advantage by not forgetting who they are talking to.

In this section where I talk about current and past leaders, I would like to give the example of Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ±, the founder of Sabancƒ± Holding. He stands out with his strong bonds with his employees and his empathy. He is a leader who is especially concerned about the welfare of his employees and does everything to motivate them.

## Conclusion

In this article, I have focused on effective leadership in general and touched upon its cornerstones, giving examples from the present and the past. By making you think of yourself in that environment, I made the subject more reinforced.`,

# Empathy: The Secret Weapon of Successful Leaders

## Introduction

Hi everyone!

This article focuses on why leaders need to develop empathy and why it is indispensable for them. In this article, I will provide real life examples to illustrate this point.

I wish good readings to everyone.

First of all, I would like to start by defining empathy.

**Empathy:** I think empathy is the ability to put yourself in the situation of the person next to you and to strategize as if you were living that moment.

From explaining the other person's problems to finding a solution to their problems, empathy is a trait that a leader absolutely must have.

Now I would like to share with you the definitions and thoughts of famous leaders of our time about empathy.

> *"Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the ability to relate to and connect with people for the purpose of inspiring and empowering their lives."* ‚Äî Oprah Winfrey

> *"Leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking care of those in your charge."* ‚Äî Simon Sinek

When we look at famous leaders in general, you can see that they can agree with me on this. Empathy is not only indispensable for leaders, but also an important weapon, given its definition and importance.

Now I would like to emphasize the importance of empathy once again, using real-life examples.

## Example 1: Howard Schultz ‚Äî Starbucks and Value Given to Employees

As CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz is known for his empathy towards his employees. In the 1980s, at a time when Starbucks was growing rapidly, Schultz decided to provide health insurance for all employees, despite facing financial difficulties. Many executives said the move would be too costly for the company. But Schultz treated his employees not just as "workers" but as "human beings". This empathetic leadership decision contributed greatly to Starbucks' brand culture and success. As a result, employees felt valued and this translated into better service, which was reflected in the customers.

## Conclusion

In this article, I have focused on why leaders should have empathy in general and tried to reinforce the topic by giving a real life example.`,

# Leadership in a Crisis: A Guide to Dealing with Challenges

## Introduction

Hi everyone!

This article is about how important leadership is in a crisis and how a leader should behave in a crisis. In this article you will find several important quotes as well as real life examples.

I wish good readings to everyone.

In general, before we start, I would like to ask you a few questions to think about. The first one is "**What characteristics do you think a leader should have in a crisis?**". The other one is "**If a leader does not manage a crisis well, does that make him a bad leader?**".

If you have answered the questions, you are ready to start.

Leadership in Crisis is one of the most important parts of leadership. Because leadership skills are one of the most important qualities needed especially in times of crisis. These leaders are expected to resolve the confusion that arises, especially in times of crisis, and therefore leadership is indispensable.

## How Important Leadership is in Crisis?

The leader is usually at the center of the organization. These leaders are generally responsible for their teams, from the motivation of the team to how they do their work. This is why leaders are so important, both because they are at the center and because they occupy the most important positions in an organization.

There are many important quotes about this.

> **"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way."** ‚Äî John C. Maxwell

Here, **John C. Maxwell** emphasized the importance of leaders in times of crisis when he said that leaders know the way, follow the way and show the way. The ability of leaders to find the way is one of the characteristics that should stand out especially in times of crisis.

> **"The ultimate measure of a leader is not where they stand in moments of comfort, but where they stand at times of challenge and controversy."** ‚Äî Martin Luther King Jr.

Thus, **Martin Luther King Jr.** emphasizes that leaders must step forward, especially in times of crisis, and that this is a measuring test for leadership.

> **"The true test of leadership is how well you function in a crisis."** ‚Äî Brian Tracy

As Martin Luther King Jr. said here, American/Canadian Motivonal Speaker **Brian Tracy** said the same thing on the same subject. He also considered it as a measure of leadership.

When we look at important figures in the field of leadership, the fact that they always refer to leadership in times of crisis reveals that this issue is more important than one might think. So whoever you are reading this article, I suggest you pay attention to leadership and improve yourself :))))

In another topic, we will focus on which characteristics of the leader should be emphasized during a crisis.

## What Qualities Does a Leader Possess in a Crisis?

In this section, I will focus on five crucial characteristics of leadership in a crisis: **being good coordinator**, **decisiveness**, **experience**, **goal-driven orientation** and **strong communicator**.

### 1- Being Good Coordinator

Being a good coordinator is one of the most important qualities of a leader. Because leaders are generally responsible for team management. They face many crises while managing the team. But with their successful coordination skills, they can easily overcome them.

In this section I would like to share with you an important quote that is relevant to this topic.

> **"In times of crisis, a leader's role is to provide clarity, consistency, and calm coordination."** ‚Äî Tony Blair

As Tony Blair points out, one of the most important characteristics of a leader in a crisis is the ability to coordinate calmly.

### 2- Decisiveness

In times of crisis, leaders face many challenges and it is crucial to make quick and correct decisions and stand by them. This is where decisiveness comes in. Being able to make decisions without getting lost in many options is an indispensable leadership trait and leaders who do not have this trait should definitely focus on this part in order to become a better leader.

Imagine that you work in a company. Your team leader in this company changes his/her mind every hour and cannot be decisive. Do you think a leader who cannot make decisions even in normal times can make decisions in times of crisis? Definitely not. That's why this trait is very valuable.

### 3- Experience

In times of crisis, what is more valuable than a team member who has faced the crisis before? Nothing is above that. With this in mind, wouldn't it be a great opportunity for the team if the leader had experienced this crisis before? Of course, the team leader would immediately take action and quickly bring the crisis to an end.

Experience is one of the indispensable characteristics of a leader in a crisis, as in most situations. This situation brings other characteristics of the leader to the forefront. A good leader has many experiences and is able to incorporate them into his/her life.

### 4- Goal-Driven Orientation

Goal-Driven Orientation is especially important in times of crisis when decisions need to be made and implemented very quickly. Because if goal-driven orientation is not present in times of crisis, the situation will become even more complicated than it already is.

Well, can you imagine how the team will run towards the goal if the leader has this feature in times of crisis? That's why leaders need this feature.

### 5- Strong Communicator

A leader whose communication skills are lagging behind cannot be considered, and a leader who does not bring these qualities to the forefront in times of crisis cannot be considered. In this case, the leader must have this quality and must definitely use and develop it continuously.

Since this part is very obvious, instead of writing more about this part, I would like to continue with this quote from Simon Sinek.

> **"In a crisis, a good leader listens first, speaks second, and acts third."** ‚Äî Simon Sinek

Simon Sinek offers us a succinct suggestion in this regard. He explains how we can be a good communicator in a crisis with a very beautiful word.

## Conclusion

In this article we have focused on why leadership is important in times of crisis and what characteristics a leader should have in times of crisis. While focusing on these issues, I had the chance to share with you the words of some important thinkers while focusing on real world examples.`,

# What is the Difference Between a Leader and a Boss?

## Introduction

Hi everyone!

This article focuses on the differences between leader and manager. It does this by citing various quotations and giving examples from some contemporary stories.

I wish good readings to everyone.

First of all, I would like to start by explaining the terms I will use a lot in this article, leader and manager.

**Leader:** I will use the term "*leader*" as a person who walks the path with his team, who can communicate openly with his team when a problem arises and who ensures that the team walks the right path with his guidance.

**Boss:** I will use the term "*boss*" to refer to a person who prefers to be in a managerial position rather than walking the path with his team, and who prefers to manage only his team.

## What are Differences Between Leader and Boss?

### 1) Say "I" or "We" ?

There is a big difference between I and we, especially in a team work. A leader who says "we" is eager to walk this path with his team and shows that he will face any possible success or failure together with his team. But for a boss to say "I" all the time is very bad for the team.

### 2) Takes or Gives Credit ?

As I mentioned above, a leader praises successful members of his team and makes them feel that their work is valuable. But a boss always takes the credit to himself and always blames the team for failures, which has a very bad effect on the team organization.

### 3) Micromanages or Delegates ?

A leader who delegates tasks effectively empowers their team by trusting them with responsibilities and encouraging their growth, whereas a boss who micromanages every detail undermines their team's confidence and stifles creativity, leading to diminished morale and productivity.

### 4) Criticizes or Encourages?

Even if a member of their team makes a mistake, leaders try to motivate them and take the time to bring them back into the team. But bosses do not encourage in any way and always criticize team members. In this case, teams with leaders can work more effectively.

### 5) Focuses on Weaknesses or Strengths?

While leaders focus on the strengths of their teammates, bosses always focus on the weaknesses of their employees. In this situation, team members who have a boss always think that something is wrong with them and they cannot give the performance they want.

### 6) Blames Others or Takes Responsibility?

Leaders do not try to blame other teammates. They take responsibility by taking it upon themselves. In this way, teammates can act more freely and devote all the strength they can to work. But in teams where there are bosses, the team no longer wants to take responsibility because they always blame the team members.

### 7) Directs or Coaches?

Leaders support team members in difficult situations by coaching them without directing them directly. In this way, team members feel happy and empowered when they solve their own problems. But in an environment where there are bosses, they direct the employees to the right result and the team members complete the work without gaining anything from that work. Employees who are denied the chance to gain new experience lose in the long run, even if they get rid of the job momentarily.

### 8) Speaks or Listens More?

It is a well-known fact that those who listen before they speak win in the long run. Leaders focus on solving real problems by listening more to their teammates. Bosses, on the other hand, talk a lot without listening, so they talk a lot before they even understand the problems. This creates a huge disadvantage for the team.

### 9) Inspires Fear or Enthusiasm

Leaders are not afraid to create enthusiasm and especially expect their teams to be enthusiastic. Bosses, on the other hand, spend a lot of time creating fear because they believe that by creating various fears, their employees will work harder.

### 10) Commands or Asks?

Bosses love to give commands. That's why they always prefer to give commands. Leaders, on the other hand, determine their future moves by asking their teammates for their opinion. Team members who feel valued work more diligently.

# Leading in the Age of Remote Work

## Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Berk. The topic I would like to talk to you about today is leadership in remote work, a feature that came into our lives with Covid-19. Remote working is a model that has suddenly entered our lives and is now generally preferred by employees.

But we will reflect on how leadership, which is sometimes difficult even face to face, can benefit or harm from this situation. I think leadership is a trait that knows no boundaries and should be used and developed in all circumstances. However, in the online process, some leaders may be at a disadvantage, such as leaders who use their body language successfully, especially in situations where cameras are not used.

In this article, I will give real-life examples of some of these situations and how you can turn them to your advantage.

## Being A Leader in Remote

One of the questions on everyone's minds since the introduction of remote working is definitely now how to understand the real thinking of the other party, especially in meetings without cameras. We literally CANNOT understand. Because most of the communication processes consist of non-verbal communication.

Therefore, leaders will now need other qualities. Tone of voice will become more important and even a good leader will be one who can understand the other person's thoughts by the tone of his or her voice.

For example, when our lives were online, I was preparing for the university entrance exam. In this process, our classes were online and our teachers were hosts. He constantly reminded us that we had to turn on our camera or we might not understand the lesson. Because they could not understand the mental state of the class and they felt they were speaking into a vacuum and they did not want that.

While leadership processes change hands even in a simple classroom setting, leadership in large corporations has changed more and will change more in the future.

## Conclusion

As a result, leadership has been and will continue to be greatly affected by the online process. Therefore, it would be better to look at leadership from a larger perspective rather than from smaller perspectives.`,
